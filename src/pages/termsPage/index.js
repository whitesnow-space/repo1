            <strong>General</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi is a service that is provided both through digital solutions,
            content, and the provision of physical services from our own online
            store or from other online stores with which we cooperate. These
            terms apply to all registered users and cover all services Noddi AS
            with its subsidiaries and affiliates provide (both digital services,
            including - but not limited to - website and app, as well as
            delivery services, and all sales of goods and services). Together
            with your order, confirmed through an order confirmation, these
            conditions constitute the aggregate contractual basis for purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            At noddi.no we ask anyone who wants to use our services to register
            an account and some information about themselves in a user profile.
            Some of the information we request is required by law, some is
            necessary to deliver the service you may order and something allows
            us to make Noddi something more than just a service — namely a rich
            and inspiring ecosystem. You can read more about how we process this
            user data in our privacy policy available through our website.

          <p>
            The person who is registered with a user and as a customer of Noddi
            is responsible for payment of the services Noddi or Noddi's
            affiliates provide in accordance with these terms and conditions.
            Liability also includes the use of the Customer's access by others,
            including unauthorized use, unless it can be demonstrated that the
            unauthorized use was made possible through negligence on Noddi's
            part. A user account may only apply to one (1) person or company
            with associated personnel and user information.
          </p>

            <strong>Ordering process</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your order is binding when the order is registered on our server.
            Once we have registered your order, we will confirm it by sending
            you a booking confirmation. If one or more services in your order
            are unavailable, we reserve the right to cancel your order or any
            part of it. In the event of unavailability, you will be notified of
            this together with information about what we can offer, whether in
            the form of a refund, a benefit note, replacement service or
            subsequent provision of the service. You will then have the option
            to either accept our new offer with the changes we specify or to
            cancel that of the order affected by the discrepancy.

          <p>
            <strong>Prices and payment</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            All prices are quoted including VAT unless expressly stated
            otherwise. The total purchase price includes all costs associated
            with the purchase, including, transportation, consumables,
            equipment, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi covers a large geographical area and competes in several
            markets. As a logged in user, prices may vary depending on geography
            and local factors, such as local price competition. The prices of
            the service can also be influenced by demand and accessibility in
            your area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our prices are constantly changing and we therefore make
            reservations about price changes as a result of changing prices from
            our suppliers. We reserve the right to refuse delivery on all
            services based on price fluctuations and availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            For private clients, payment occurs after the agreed work is
            completed. If you have not registered a card with us, you will
            receive an SMS with a link to payment and a 24 hour payment
            deadline. If bills are not paid within 24 hours, a standard invoice
            is sent via a payment partner, which may incur an invoice fee. If
            the invoice is not paid within the deadline stated on the invoice,
            the invoice is automatically sent to the debt collector.
          </p>
          <p>
            For business customers, the purchase price is made up through an
            invoice sent by e-mail to the invoice address the customer has
            provided in their profile. The invoice has a 14-day payment deadline
            from the date the services are delivered unless otherwise agreed.
            For corporate customers, a credit and logistics fee is additionally
            incurred, which is added to the price of each service. The prices
            you see when you are logged into the online store are included in
            this fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi reserves the right to perform credit checks. In case of
            abnormally large orders, orders made by companies with low or no
            creditworthiness, history and/or missing or closed accounts, Noddi
            may charge an upfront payment before the order is executed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to refuse delivery. In such cases, the purchase
            price will be refunded.

          <p>
            <strong>Service Delivery and Delay</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The service is performed at the address you have provided in your
            user profile and for the time period indicated on the booking
            confirmation. Noddi requires sufficient space around the vehicle
            which means at least two (2) meters of free space on all sides of
            the vehicle without objects that impede access on the vehicle. If
            adequate access on the vehicle is not provided, Noddi makes no
            guarantee that the service can be performed to the expected quality.
            If the delivery of the services is delayed, we will provide you with
            information as soon as we have knowledge of it, together with
            information about when the service can be performed. In case of
            delayed delivery of more than 2 hours, you are free to choose
            whether to cancel the purchase or accept a new delivery time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi reserves the right of denial of service to individuals,
            households or addresses, and without giving a reason. It is
            incumbent on the customer to ensure that the service can be carried
            out according to the agreement in a decent manner. If the operator
            or other personnel performing services for Noddi express discomfort
            or perceive any part of our service performance as offensive or
            threatening, either to themselves or to others, the customer
            relationship may be terminated immediately and without compensation.

            <strong>Performance of the service</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not obliged to carry out a booking and in special cases may
            cancel or reject an appointment without the customer being entitled
            to compensation
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Keys</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for the loss of keys that are not personally
            handed over to our operator before work begins. An example of this
            may be keys posted in a secure or unsecured location or keys that
            our operator must collect from a third party (e.g. at a gas station,
            in a mailbox, or the like).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Insurance</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each completed mission is insured up to NOK 10 million for damage to
            vehicles. Unambiguous proof of the condition of the vehicle before
            and after the service has been performed must be provided and
            included with a possible claim for compensation or rectification of
            damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Child seats</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not remove child seats unless this has been agreed in advance.
            If it is agreed that the child seat should be removed, the customer
            is responsible for attaching it again.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rubbish</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not remove litter from the vehicle unless this has been agreed
            in advance. When performing interior services, any garbage or
            objects that appear as garbage will be collected and placed in the
            vehicle with the intention that the customer himself throws it away.

            <strong>Complaints</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi relates to the Consumer Purchase Act of 21. June No. 34 2002
            for general rules on complaints. Our warranties do not imply any
            limitation on the warranty period for goods under the Consumer
            Purchase Act. However, we have a customer promise that extends even
            further on some points:
          </p>
          <p>
            When receiving the Services, you should check as soon as you have
            the opportunity to do so whether the delivery complies with the
            order confirmation and whether the object has been damaged during
            the delivery of the Service. If there is damage or inadequately
            performed service, you will have the opportunity to choose either to
            have the same service performed again at a later date, or to have
            the payment for this service credited to the same account that was
            responsible for payment of the order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The customer is obliged to check that the services and delivery are
            in accordance with the order confirmation and whether the object on
            which the service has been performed has been damaged during the
            performance of the service. If the customer wants the service
            credited on the basis of guarantees or other offers and customer
            promises, the customer must claim this no later than 12 hours after
            the performance of the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Restitution of purchase, complaint or breach of warranties may be

            notify us within a reasonable time after you discovered or should
            have discovered the defect (no later than 7 days after the time of
            delivery).

            If the vehicle is not at the stated home address, or business
            address for business customers, when we arrive to perform the
            service within the agreed time period, and not otherwise agreed, we
            will try to call you at your provided telephone number to clarify
            what to do next.

            We reserve the right to charge up to NOK 300, - for agreements that
            cannot be completed if the car is unavailable. For example, in the
            case of a given incorrect location, parking in a locked garage or

            <strong>Vouchers and Gift Cards</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi may offer discounts or allowances, such as discounts, vouchers
            or gift cards, in the form of “vouchers”. Coupons are digital
            discounts that are triggered when given conditions are met. The
            coupons may be valid for a limited time, only valid for certain days
            or times of the week and are often tied to a minimum order
            requirement. Coupons cannot normally be combined on the same deal.
            The terms and conditions may vary depending on the type of voucher
            and these are stated in connection with the voucher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coupons cannot be split across multiple trades and can only be used
            once. Vouchers can therefore only be used on orders that are at
            least as large as the voucher itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi may offer discounts in the form of coupons in connection with
            promotions, e.g. to encourage you to start shopping or as rewards
            and inducements to enlist new customers. Noddi distributes such
            coupons at its sole discretion, and may change the terms of issue at
            any time. Promotional or referral coupons are initially issued both
            to the referred or invited upon registration with a unique link or
            invitation code, and to the referrer when the referred makes their
            first trade that meets the coupon's more detailed conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person can only be enlisted one (1) time, and a maximum of one (1)
            referral voucher per household can be obtained. Only real and unique
            legal persons with real personnel and domicile in Norway are
            considered valid recipients of referral vouchers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Noddi suspects any misuse of coupons (attempts to enlist yourself
            or a related party through the creation of multiple user accounts,
            enlistment on an abnormal, professional or commercial scale,
            acquisition of vouchers through violation of these Terms, or any
            other use that Noddi does not consider appropriate), we may deny you
            access to the Service, invalidate any coupons, whether or not used,
            and delete or disable the user accounts for misuse the thing has
            happened from. Noddi may additionally claim compensation for lost
            income as a result of the abuse.

            <strong>Extraordinary conditions</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Noddi is only liable for loss and damage in connection with the
            performance of the service if errors or defects are detected.
            However, this does not apply if Noddi can show that the deficiency
            is due to circumstances beyond Noddi's control, and of which Noddi
            could not reasonably be expected to avoid or overcome the
            consequences. Noddi is not liable for indirect losses resulting from
            defects unless the loss is caused by gross negligence or intent on
            Noddi's part. In the case of consumer purchases, the terms may not
            be inferior to the terms of the law, cf. Law on Consumer Purchases
            of 2002-06-21 No. 34.

            <strong>Force majeure</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Is Noddi prevented from providing compulsory service or becomes
            unduly burdensome as a result of a labor dispute or any other
            circumstance where the parties cannot control such as extreme
            weather, fire, outbreak of infection, war, mobilization or
            unforeseen military convocations of service scope, requisition,
            seizure, currency restrictions, insurrection and riot, scarcity of
            means of transport, general scarcity of goods, restrictions in the
            supply of motive power, as well as deficiencies or delays in
            deliveries from subcontractors; or manufacturers as a result of such
            circumstances as discussed in this paragraph, Noddi is exempt from
            all liability other than in the event of a claim and credit it to
            the defective service's associated purchase price.
